-   How to use `std.debug.print` with a boolean?

-   How to access the last element of `std.ArrayList`?

-   How to I make sure that the errors overlap with error names from other libraries?

-   How to return error from failable function as normal value?

-   What are the general naming conventions for `snake_case` and `camelCase`?
