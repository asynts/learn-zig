My goal is to implement a few simple tools in Zig to get familiar with the syntax.
I was thinking about `ls`, `tree`, `tar`, `jail` and `jq`.

### Development Environment

-   Install Visual Studio Code

-   Install `augusterame.zls-vscode` extension.

-   Install `zig` package in Arch Linux.

-   Currently, I am using a custom build of `zig` with whatever `zls` the extension installs.
